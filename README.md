# Hops datasets

This repository aims to provide datasets about hop varieties..

It has been extracted from the websites of hops merchants and then enhanced by
hand.

Some information might not be correct, since the sources are sparse.

If you want to give me a hand on this (propose changes, new sources, update the data) don't hesitate to open an issue, a pull-request, or to contact me at
`alexis - at - notmyidea - dot - org`. Thanks.

## Visualisations

## Want to run the scrappers yourself?

This is experimental, and not maintained, the scrappers might be useful if you
know what you're doing, but they're reading information from websites and PDF
files, which are changing over time, so if you're reading this some years after
it's been written, you have high chances that the scrappers aren't up-to-date
anymore.

They are still useful in some way, especially if you want to add some more
scrapping sources or update them. Byt consider their presence as informative only.

The main interest of this repo is the resulting graphs.

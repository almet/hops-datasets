vic-secret-r:

    Secret to embellish the world of beer flavour. The clean, distinct fruit and pine

    Late kettle additions have been found to impart a pleasant earthy character, but
    little fruit. She has very high levels of alpha acid so brewers may find it easier
    to craft the right balance in their beer by dry hopping.
